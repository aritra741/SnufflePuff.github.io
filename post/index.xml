      <description>The best way to learn about SOS DP would probably be This blog on codeforces. But I always tend to forget how the recurrence relation is constructed and have to revisit this blog over and over again.
If you&#39;ve now understood how this whole SOS DP thing works, we can dive into some problems.

      <description>String related problems used to scare the shit out of me. Then I was introduced to some string suffix structures and it absolutely blew my mind. I don&#39;t claim to be an expert on suffix structures, but I hope my approach to solve the following problems will help you get some insight.
Please keep in mind that this article is in no way an introduction to these data structures. I&#39;ll attach some links at the end.</description>
